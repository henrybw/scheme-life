scheme-life
===========

Game of Life implemented in Scheme.

Architecture
------------

* `life-core`: Implementation of the core Game of Life logic.
* `drscheme-driver`: DrScheme-based driver that presents a graphical view of `life-core`.

Usage
-----

To make things easy for myself, `life-driver` uses DrScheme's drawing toolkit.

TODO: Write usage notes for `life-driver` once it's working.
